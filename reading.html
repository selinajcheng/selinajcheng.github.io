        <b>Update as of 2025-12-17</b>: This page is currently outdated. I am more active on logging on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118060361-selina">Goodreads</a>, though I am now moving towards spending more time reading papers than I am reading books.

    <h2>Thoughts On Reading</h2>
    <p>
        For a long while, I have been neglecting a dedicated practice to reading published books (generally reputable or vetted texts) and I'm rectifying that now through consistency. The reading log will include not just books, but essays, blogs, and all sorts of texts I find.<br/>
        <br/>
        I'm thinking of modeling it after Derek Siver's <a href="https://sive.rs/book">Book Notes</a> but more compact from the viewing page. Just an experiment. I might decide to primarily use Obsidian instead if it proves a better experience than logging here.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to reading, I'd like to try introducing intention and thought as well. One thing I'm starting to experiment with is writing out my thoughts quickly right after finishing a natural or defined section, e.g., chapter, as a means to reflect and process. I immensely dislike being pulled from a state of flow but if I slowly ingratiate myself to a method of reading other than bulldozing through the text, I might just grow to like it. Maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important qualifier is that good books are meant to be re-read. This page will list only the first completion date. I will add a "Last Read:" bullet if I re-read.
