<h2>Part I - The Vow</h2>
<h3>How It Started</h3>
<blockquote>
It's interesting what goes through your minds at moments like these. Time slows down, yes. But that's almost cliché. There's only the podium and the microphone. You step up. The audience grows blurry, as if out of focus. Clock starts.<br/>
And then I knew what to do. I would offer something no one else could. My truth. Something I'd learned purely from my experience, something that saved me. The audience came into focus.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
But what surprised me was that life got better on its own. Within a month, my life had transformed. The only constant being the vow I'd made to myself and how I kept it.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
One woman told me that sitting in the audience, listening to me, she'd realized that this was the reason she came. All I'd done was share a truth I'd learned.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
"You have to," James wrote back. "This is the only message that's important."
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
"I don't do a post now unless I'm worried about what people will think about me."
</blockquote>
I really like the principle of doing exactly what you're afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
The "James" here is Mr. James Altucher.

<h3>What Is This About?</h3>
<blockquote>
Loving yourself. [...] It's something I learned from within myself, something I believe saved me. And more than that, the way I set about to do it. Most of it, simple enough to be idiotic. But in simplicity lies truth. In simplicity lies power.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
The truth is to love yourself with the same intensity you would use to pull yourself up if you were hanging off a cliff with your fingers. As if your life depended upon it.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<h3>Beginning</h3>
<blockquote>
I'd reached my breaking point. I remember it well. I couldn't take it anymore. I was done. Done with all of this. This misery, this pain, this angst, this being me. I was sick of it, done.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
<i>This day, I vow to myself to love myself, to treat myself as someone I love truly and deeply—in my thoughts, my actions, the choices I make, the experiences I have, each moment I am conscious, I make the decision I LOVE MYSELF.</i>
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
There was nothing left to say. How long it took me to write this, less than a minute. But the intensity, it felt like I was carving words onto paper, through the desk. I'd been disgusted with myself—I could love another, but what about me? From now on, I would focus only on this thought. For me.
</blockquote>
<br/>

<blockquote>
How to love myself, I did not know. All I knew was that I'd made a vow—something far greater than a want or desire, an I-wish or a nice-to-have. A vow. I had to go all in or destroy myself trying. There was no middle ground.
