<h2>Part I - The Vow</h2>
<h3>How It Started</h3>
<blockquote>
It's interesting what goes through your minds at moments like these. Time slows down, yes. But that's almost clich√©. There's only the podium and the microphone. You step up. The audience grows blurry, as if out of focus. Clock starts.

And then I knew what to do. I would offer something no one else could. My truth. Something I'd learned purely from my experience, something that saved me. The audience came into focus.
