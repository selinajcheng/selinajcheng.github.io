    <h2>Chapter 1 - What makes for a dream job?</h2>
    <p>
        Finding a dream job that's enjoyable and meaningful doesn't involve a) discovering passion through a flash of insight, or b) a job that is easy and high-paid.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Rather, you can develop passion while doing work that you find enjoyable and meaningful.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Past $75,000, increases in income do not substantially affect happiness, sadness, or stress. Past $50,000, increases in income do not affect life satisfaction. High-earning jobs do not equate to high levels of happiness. For reference, these statements are based on Kahneman and A. Deaton's 2010 study.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Many people tell us they want to "find a job that's not too stressful." [...] One puzzle is that studies of high-ranking government and military leaders found they had <i>lower</i> levels of stress hormones and less anxiety, despite sleeping fewer hours, managing more people and having greater demands placed upon them.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I personally thought this was really intriguing and promising. I feel this is likely true for CEOs and founders as well.
    </p>

    <h3>What should you aim for in a dream job?</h3>
    <h4>1. Work that's engaging</h4>
    <p>
        Engaging work is work that allows you to enter a state of flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Four factors that make work engaging:
        <ol>
            <li>The <b>freedom</b> to decide how to perform your work.</li>
            <li><b>Clear tasks</b>, with a clearly defined start and end.</li>
            <li><b>Variety</b> in the types of task.</li>
            <li><b>Feedback</b>, so you know how well you're doing.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>2. Work that helps others</h4>
    <h4>3. Work you're good at</h4>
    <h4>4. Work with supportive colleagues</h4>
    <blockquote>
        A bad boss can ruin a dream position, while even boring work can be fun if done with a friend.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        <b>Question:</b> What are examples of workplace cultures?
    </p>

    <h4>5. Lack of major negatives</h4>
    <p>
        All of the following tend to be linked to job <i>dis</i>satisfication:
        <ol>
            <li>A long commute, especially if it's over an hour by bus.</li>
            <li>Very long hours.</li>
            <li>Pay you feel is unfair.</li>
            <li>Job insecurity.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>6. Work that fits with the rest of your life</h4>

    <h3>Should you just follow your passion?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        The idea is that the key to finding a great career is to identify your greatest interest — "your passion" — and pursue a career involving that interest. It's an attractive message: just commit to your passion, and you'll have a great career. And when we look at successful people, they <i>are</i> often passionate about what they do.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        But that doesn't necessarily mean causation.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        If you don't have a "passion", don't worry. You can still find work you'll become passionate about. [...] You can start a career in a new area. If your work helps others, you practice to get good at it, you have engaging tasks, and you work with people you like, then you'll <i>become</i> passionate about it.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <b>Many successful people are passionate, but often their passion developed alongside their success.</b>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Rather than having a single passion, in reality our interests change often, and more than we expect.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        This all means you have more options for a fulfilling career than you might first think.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Do what contributes to the world</h3>
    <blockquote>
        We highlight "getting good", because if you find something you're good at that others value, you'll have plenty of career opportunities.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <i>Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness.</i><br/> - Martin Luther King, Jr.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        What's more, [...] as a college graduate in a developed country today, you have an enormous opportunity to help others through your career. Ultimately, this is the real reason to focus on helping others — the fact that it'll make you more personally fulfilled is just a bonus.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <blockquote>
            To have a dream job, don't worry too much about money and stress, and don't endlessly self-reflect to find your one true passion.<br/>
            Rather get good at something that helps others. It's best for you, and it's best for the world.
